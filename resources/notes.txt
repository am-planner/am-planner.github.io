Abstract:Expressive motion planning for Aerial Manipulators (AMs) is essential for tackling complex manipulation tasks, yet achieving coupled trajectory planning adaptive to various tasks remains challenging, especially for those requiring aggressive maneuvers. In this work, we propose a novel whole-body integrated motion planning framework for quadrotor-based AMs that leverages flexible waypoint constraints to achieve versatile manipulation capabilities.
These waypoint constraints enable the specification of individual position requirements for either the quadrotor or end-effector, while also accommodating higher-order velocity and orientation constraints for complex manipulation tasks.
To implement our framework, we exploit spatio-temporal trajectory characteristics and formulate an optimization problem to generate feasible trajectories for both the quadrotor and manipulator while ensuring collision avoidance considering varying robot configurations, dynamic feasibility, and kinematic feasibility. Furthermore, to enhance the maneuverability for specific tasks, we employ Imitation Learning (IL) to facilitate the optimization process to avoid poor local optima. The effectiveness of our framework is validated through comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments, where we successfully demonstrate nine fundamental manipulation skills across various environments.

Contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Whole-body Planning Framework}: We propose a novel whole-body integrated motion planning framework for aerial manipulators. This framework simultaneously optimizes the trajectory of both the quadrotor and the manipulator to achieve coordinating whole-body motion and complete a series of tasks, strike, grasp, lift, write, pull, push, wind, cross and press. Additionally, we develop a novel varying ellipsoid method to model the changing collision volume to guarantee the whole-body collision-free manipulations under any requirements. 

    \item \textbf{Flexible Partial Waypoint Constraint}: We introduce a comprehensive waypoint constraint formulation that enables selective specification of position, velocity, or orientation requirements for individual quadrotors or end-effectors at different waypoints. This approach allows flexible task-specific partial waypoint constraints that only constrain the necessary degrees of freedom while leaving others free for optimization, providing significantly greater flexibility and more constraint options compared to existing methods.

    \item \textbf{IL-Guided Optimization for Complex Tasks}: We introduce an IL-guided optimization approach to overcome poor local optima in challenging manipulation scenarios, such as grasping or striking on inclined surfaces. The method learns from high-quality demonstration data to generate a sequence of waypoints to guide the optimization process in the first stage, and then progressively relaxes these guided constraints in the second stage to find better solutions.

    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Validation and Open-source Implementation:} We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our framework through extensive validation, including diverse benchmark tasks, ablation studies, simulations on different types of manipulators, and real-world aerial manipulation experiments. The complete framework is made publicly available to support the research community and promote reproducible research in aerial manipulation planning.
